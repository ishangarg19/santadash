Made an endless runner game similar to the No Internet Chrome Dino game using Java Swing. 

Download the Santa Dash.zip file to play the game as a .exe application for Windows x64 systems (Does NOT need the .java files to run). Make sure to keep the ``resources`` folder in the same location as the .exe application.

View the code in the .java files. The program javadoc is also added.
